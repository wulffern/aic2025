<!--pan_title: The Story of Jayn-->

I want to tell you a story about Jayn. Jayn is an electron. Just one among
countless others. There's nothing particularly special about Jayn, but he plays
an important role in our story.


At one point in his long life, without knowing it, Jayn would cause problems for
us -- but that's not where his story begins.


Jayn's story begins 13.8 billion years ago. He popped into existence out of the
vacuum, seemingly alone in the world. Well, not entirely alone. Jayn was
surrounded by cousins and friends, an ocean of elementary particles. There were
quarks, there were electrons, and they all swam together in a sea of raw energy
and matter.


Before long, the quarks got tired of floating around on their own. They clumped
together, forming protons -- massive beasts compared to little Jayn. Jayn didn't
like this new, crowded world. She loved the freedom of zipping around the
universe unbound. But eventually, she felt a tug -- a deep, irresistible attraction
to one of those giant protons. And with that, she became part of something new:
a hydrogen atom.


Jayn lived in that hydrogen atom for billions of years. Over time, she joined
with other hydrogen atoms, coalescing into a star. She basked in the warmth of
its outer layers, content as the star burned brightly in the universe.


Eventually, though, her hydrogen atom drifted toward the star's core. There,
something new happened. Instead of circling just one proton, she now orbited
two. A new proton had joined, forming helium. This meant there was space for
another electron too -- her first real companion.


They shared the same orbital space, something Jayn had never experienced before.
Usually, if another electron came too close, one of them would be pushed away.
But not this time. This was different. They could exist in the same place, with
the same energy. How? Physicists would later call it "spin". Jayn didn't know
what "spin" meant, it was weird, but she liked it. It meant she wasn't alone.


Jayn was happy in her helium atom, but the universe never stands still. Another
proton came, then another, and eventually Jayn found herself part of a silicon
atom, orbiting a nucleus with 14 protons and -- of course -- 14 electrons.

She was no longer close to the nucleus. Now, she was far out on the edge, in the
outermost orbital shell. From there, she could feel the presence of everything around
her -- not just her own atom, but all the neighboring atoms as well.

But one day, everything
changed. Her star exploded -- a supernova -- and she was flung
across the universe.

For a time, Jayn was adrift again. Not alone, but not close to anything
familiar. Eventually, she was caught in the gravity of a forming planet -- the one
we now call Earth. Her silicon atom joined with other atoms, mostly oxygen. The
allure of the other atoms  wasn't strong, but it was always there.

Jayn stayed part of that silicate crystal for around five billion years.
She spent billions of years tumbling through Earth's oceans,
sometimes bonding with other atoms, sometimes drifting free. One day, she washed
up on a beach, part of a grain of sand. And there she stayed for a long, long
time.

Now and then, she was swept out to sea again, then returned, living a simple,
chaotic, quiet life.

But even quiet lives face change. One day, she was picked up -- scooped up in a
handful of sand, melted down, and turned into something new. It had happened
before. Being melted just meant more energy, more vibration. Sometimes, she even
had enough energy to escape her atom briefly before settling back down. But this
time was different.

This time, she became part of something incredibly uniform: a crystal lattice
where every atom around her was another silicon atom, each in perfect order. For
the first time, she could feel the full, equal pull of the electrons and nuclei
around her -- like a vast, invisible ocean of charges. It was electrifying.


<!--Time usually passed slowly for Jayn. Electrons moved so fast that the rest of
the universe seemed to crawl. But now, she could feel something speeding up. -->


<!-- Electrons were whizzing byâ€”sometimes so fast that they couldn't physically move
any faster, bumping into other atoms in their haste. A disturbance. She couldn't
tell what it was, only that it was coming. -->

Then one day, it happened. Another electron struck. It hit hard -- so hard that Jayn was knocked from her
orbital shell. For a brief moment, she was free. She flew through the crystal lattice,
disoriented, until she found another open spot -- an empty energy state -- where she
could settle again. It was strange but exhilarating.

And did you know? The presence of just that one electron -- Jayn -- was enough to
shift the threshold voltage of a transistor, change the flow of bias current, alter the
frequency of an oscillator, cause my phone
to loose the Bluetooth link to my door look, and made me swear a number of
times until the Bluetooth link finally reconnected, many, many, many seconds later.

And yet, her story doesn't end. Because Jayn, like all electrons, never really
ends. She may pop in and out of existence, but she is always there -- unchanged,
identical to all her cousins and siblings.

The only differences between them are where they are, their momentum and yes, their "spin".

So ends the story of Jayn -- our 13.8 billion-year-old friend.
