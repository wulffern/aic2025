 \textbf{Carsten Wulff}
received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in
electrical engineering from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU),
in 2002 and 2008, respectively. 
During his Ph.D. work at NTNU, he worked on open-loop sigma-delta
modulators and analog-to-digital converters in nanoscale CMOS
technologies. In 2006-2007, he was a Visiting Researcher with the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of
Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. Since 2008 he's been with Nordic Semiconductor in
various roles, from analog designer, to Wireless Group Manager, to currently
Principle IC Scientist. He's also an Adjunct Associate Professor at NTNU. His
present research interests includes analog and mixed-signal CMOS
design, design of high-efficiency analog-to-digital converters and
low-power wireless transceivers. He is the developer of Custom IC
